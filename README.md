# Project Express API

This project was a fun introduction to backend by creating an API in Node using Express. 

## The problem

The problem encountered was to type any name or title without the need to print out exact word but rather using lower case or just simply typing a part of the name/title. 
Using the include and filter() method I managed to solve this problem. If I would have more time I would try to play around with query params in the endpoints that were created.
