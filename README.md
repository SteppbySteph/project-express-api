# Project Express API

This project was a fun introduction to backend by creating an API in Node using Express. 

## The problem

There were some issues throwing error messages with the filter method at first. But thanks to StackOverflow I found a way to solve this. 
Playing around with query and path params was a fun practice for this project.
